### What I learned

Went back to using a stylesheet after using Tailwind for a while. Didn't feel right, but not too much of a hassle. Not perfect paddings/margins/font sizes since they aren't all provided. Focused on just getting the layout for the given screen sizes (375px, 1440px). Definetey wouldn't use this in a project unless I was able to make the design more responsive (ie: medium screens/tablets/smaller laptops). Learned more about the different ways to use CSS Grid. I took an absolute wrong approach in my solution and I wouldn't recommend it. 4 columns and 10 rows for the 1440px screen size and 1 column 40 rows for the 375px screen size. Used row-grid and column-grid to define the size of each grid item. Used the gap property to space out the grid items. Took much longer than I thought. Ended up cheating the grid items by using padding and margins that I wouldn't be happy using elsewhere.

### Continued development

Still need to work more with grid properties in responsive designs.
